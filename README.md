Summary of the knowledge that is useful/popular in machine learning/data science, but explored less by me due to time constraint

## LSTM
1. https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21 is a very clear explanation for beginners.
2. http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ is another good resource, expecially for how the vector flows.
3. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html is the official explanation in Pytorch.
