Summary of the knowledge that is useful/popular in machine learning/data science, but explored less by me due to time constraint

## LSTM
1. https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21 is a very clear explanation for beginners.
2. http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ is another good resource, expecially for how the vector flows.
3. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html is the official explanation in Pytorch.

## Loss Functions
1. [torch.nn.NLLLoss()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.NLLLoss.html): The negative log likelihood loss, which is useful to train a classification problem with C classes. Basically it is negative log of softmax. Here is good explanation: https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/
